        question: "What are coronaviruses?",
        answer:
            "Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause infection in humans and various animals, including birds and mammals such as camels, cats and bats. Some animal coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are communicable from animals to humans. To date, it has been confirmed that seven coronaviruses can also cause infection in humans. When animal coronaviruses evolve, infect humans and spread between humans, this can lead to outbreaks such as MERS-CoV and SARS."),
    Faq(
        question: "Where did the new coronavirus (COVID-19) originate?",
        answer:
            "COVID-19 is a new strain of the coronavirus which has not previously been detected in humans. The outbreak started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei province. The outbreak initially appeared to be linked to South China Seafood City. Seafood, chickens, bats, marmots and other wild animals are sold at this market, suggesting that the virus likely originates from an animal source. The virus is human-to-human transmissible and has meanwhile spread to other countries."),
    Faq(
        question:
            "What does a coronavirus (COVID19) infection mean for a healthy person in their twenties, thirties or forties?",
        answer:
            "The chance that a healthy person in their twenties, thirties or forties will get the coronavirus is just as high as the chance that someone else becomes infected by the virus. Hospital admissions and other complications related to the coronavirus are rare within this age group. However, complications are rare in this age group, which means that few people need to be hospitalised due to the coronavirus."),
    Faq(
        question: "Who is more at risk?",
        answer:
            "People over 65 years of age, people with diabetes, people with heart disease, lung or kidney disease and people whose immune system is weakened."),
    Faq(
        question: "Are pregnant women more at risk?",
        answer:
            "There is no scientific evidence that pregnant women are more vulnerable to this infection or to its consequences. It is reassuring that there are few pregnant women among the very ill. There are also very few serious cases of infection among women of childbearing age. There is no evidence that an infection during pregnancy has a negative effect on the fetus or that the virus can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy"),
    Faq(
        question: "Are children more at risk of being infected?",
        answer:
            "Children may also become infected with the coronavirus, but they run little risk of becoming very ill. However, they can easily transmit the virus, even if they have no symptoms yet. We therefore advise avoiding contact between children and risk groups, such as their grandparents."),
    Faq(
        question:
            "Children may also become infected with the coronavirus, but they run little risk of becoming very ill. However, they can easily transmit the virus, even if they have no symptoms yet. We therefore advise avoiding contact between children and risk groups, such as their grandparents.",
        answer:
            "Stay home as much as possible. Avoid contact with others outside your family and follow all hygiene measures carefully. It is also better for family members to avoid contacts with other people."),
    Faq(
        question:
            "Am I protected against COVID-19 if I got vaccinated against influenza or pneumococcus this year?",
        answer:
            "Influenza and the virus that causes COVID-19 are two very different viruses. The seasonal influenza vaccine does not protect against COVID-19. The pneumococcal vaccine does not protect against viral pneumonia."),
    Faq(
        question: "How does the coronavirus spread?",
        answer:
            "The coronavirus spreads from human to human via small droplets that are released when coughing and sneezing. Via these droplets, the virus ends up in the air, on objects and surfaces. Whoever inhales these droplets or gets them through their hands into their mouth, nose or eyes can become infected with the virus. There is no evidence that the contamination occurs through the skin. The risk of infection is reduced by keeping more than a metre away from sick people, touching one’s face as little as possible and paying attention to good hand hygiene."),
    Faq(
        question:
            "Is there a risk of infection through contact with objects and surfaces?",
        answer:
            "This risk exists, but is much smaller than through direct contact with an infected person. In ideal conditions, the corona virus survives on average around three hours on smooth surfaces and materials (such as door handles, handrails, tables, etc.). On absorbent materials (such as cardboard, paper, textiles, etc.), the virus cannot survive well. The virus is very sensitive to dehydration, heat and sunlight. Anyone who ingests virus droplets via contact with hands in their mouth, nose or eyes can become infected with the virus. It is important to wash your hands regularly and thoroughly after contact with surfaces and packaging that are touched by many people."),
    Faq(
        question: "Will the coronavirus disappear in the spring?",
        answer:
            "There is currently no evidence that the coronavirus will slow down or disappear due to spring weather. If we compare with other coronaviruses, it is possible that the new virus will also show a seasonal course, and that spring will slow down the spread due to higher temperatures and UV light. After a few months out of circulation, the virus may come back later. However, it is too early to know the pattern of this virus."),
    Faq(
        question:
            "I am a train controller, a receptionist, I work at the airport desk: is it dangerous to constantly take objects from people?",
        answer:
            "Taking and touching objects from people and passing them on is hard to avoid. Hence the importance to wash your hands regularly and thoroughly. Try to be especially careful to touch your face with your hands as little as possible."),
    Faq(
        question: "Can I be contaminated through food?",
        answer:
            "To this day, food has not been identified as a probable source or route of transmission of the virus. In addition, coronaviruses are not highly resistant viruses in the environment and are rapidly inactivated when they end up on surfaces. In the current state of knowledge, the likelihood of a consumer becoming contaminated with Covid-19 through food is therefore very low and unproven. Whatever the case, the FASFC reminds professionals that compliance with good hygiene practices is essential and prevents most contaminations:\n\nPrepare food separately, especially when handling raw meat, Wash food preparation surfaces, especially those used for raw meat preparations, with soap and hot water, Wash hands with soap and warm water between each handling of food,Cook all raw meat sufficiently (70°C through for at least 2 minutes), Avoid preparing food if you are sick."),
    Faq(
        question:
            "Can pets infect humans if they have been in contact with infected persons?",
        answer:
            "The risk of contracting Covid-19 through contact with pets is currently considered negligible, as Covid-19 is mainly transmitted through close contact between humans. Even though Covid-19 is suspected to have originated from wild animals and has since adapted to humans (making it a ‘humanised’ virus), until now there is no evidence to suggest that pets pose a risk to humans due to the transmission of Covid-19. That is why we advise you to apply the general rules of hygiene (avoid close contact with your pet, especially if you are sick, wash your hands after touching an animal) if you come into contact with animals that may carry the virus for a brief period of time due to environmental contamination."),
    Faq(
        question: "What should I do if I have symptoms?",
        answer:
            "Do not show up unannounced to your doctor’s office or an emergency service: instead, contact your doctor by telephone first. Mention your symptoms, contacts and travel history. Based on a specific procedure, your doctor will be able to assess who should be considered for a coronavirus test. Please bear in mind that you may also have contracted seasonal influenza."),
